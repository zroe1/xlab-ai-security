## Overview

Welcome to the XLab AI Security Guide. **You can view the contents of the course at https://xlabaisecurity.com/**

This course covers a wide variety of topics in AI Security. For each topic we cover, there is webpage describing the concept ([example here](https://xlabaisecurity.com/adversarial/cw/)). For most topic pages, the website will link to a series of coding excercises for hands on experience with the concepts we describe. You will have the option to run the code you write either locally or in the cloud with Google Colab. 

This project is still in development. For now, most of the content in the [adversarial basis](https://xlabaisecurity.com/adversarial/introduction/) sections are completed. We are currently developing the [LLM jailbreaking](https://xlabaisecurity.com/jailbreaking/introduction/) sections and hope to be done in the next few weeks. 

If you want to get started using our guide, below are some useful links:

1. [The welcome page](https://xlabaisecurity.com/getting-started/welcome/): This explains what we mean by "AI security" and why we think this area of work is important.
2. [Prerequisites](https://xlabaisecurity.com/getting-started/prerequisites/): Before diving into the content of the course, you should not skip this page so you are aware of what we assume you know.
3. [Installation](https://xlabaisecurity.com/getting-started/set-up/): If you are not planning on running your code in Google Colab, you will have to install a few packages. This page provides instructions for how to install these packages including [xlab-security](https://pypi.org/project/xlab-security/) which we developed internally.

## Development Details

In this monorepo we include our python package, the website, and the code for every pretrained model we developed for this course. Note that all models are hosted on our [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/uchicago-xlab-ai-security) rather than our GitHub.

test pypi link for python package: https://test.pypi.org/project/xlab-security/

final pypi link for python package: https://pypi.org/project/xlab-security/

install testing version of package:
```
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ xlab-security
```

Install production version of package:

```
pip install xlab-security
```

To import the package simply:

```
import xlab
```

## For the web app

To run the app locally run:

```
cd ai-security-course
npm run dev
```


To build the app run:

```
rm -rf .next
npm run export
```

This will generate an `out` directory which can be placed on a web server.
