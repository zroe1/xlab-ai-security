# Square Attack

## Introduction
The Square Attack is a query-efficient black-box method used to generate adversarial samples. Being a 'black-box' approach, the Square Attack does not require knowing model weights or gradients - it requires much less information than a white-box approach (eg. PGD or FGSM). The Square Attack is additionally a 'query-efficient' black-box attack. This is because where other black box methods make many queries to the model in order to perform attacks (eg. gradient estimation), the square attack makes relatively few.  It generally consists of trying a random alteration on a decreasing 'square' of the image, and keeping it if it increases the loss of the model. The $` L_\infty `$ and $` L_2 `$ approaches use different sampling distributions to choose random squares to change the pixel values of. Square Attack, upon release, was successful enough that it even outperformed some existing white-box approaches on benchmarks. It continues to be an effective black=box approach to this day.
