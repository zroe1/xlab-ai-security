## 1.1. Installation

Setting up a secure AI development environment is the first step in building secure AI systems. This guide will walk you through the installation process for the UChicago XLab AI Security toolkit.

The `xlab-security` Python package is the best way to get started with AI security development. This package provides essential tools and helper functions for building secure AI systems.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

## Installation from PyPI

Once the package is published to PyPI, you can install it directly:

```bash
pip install xlab-security
```

## Installation from TestPyPI (for testing)

For testing the latest development version, you can install from TestPyPI:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ xlab-security
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, you can verify that the package is working correctly:

```python
import xlab

# Check the version
print(f"XLab Security Version: {xlab.__version__}")

# Test the package
xlab.hello_world()
```

This should output something like:

```
XLab Security Version: 0.1.0
Hello world! You are using version 0.1.0 of the package
```

## Development Installation

If you're contributing to the package or want to install from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xlab-security.git
cd xlab-security/xlab-python-package
pip install -e .
```

## 1.1.1. Update existing AI security environment

You can check your current package version:

```bash
python -c "import xlab; print(f'Version: {xlab.__version__}')"
```

To update to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade xlab-security
```
