In general, our course requires fairly basic requirements: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/),
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), etc. One less conventional package you will need to
install is our own [xlab-security](https://pypi.org/project/xlab-security/) package which you will use for utility functions and running
tests.

Please note that if you plan on running our code primarily on Google Colab, you won't
have to install anything manually. It is still recommended that you read this document.

## Installing xlab-security

To install `xlab-security` all you will need to do is run:

```
pip install xlab-security
```

Or within a jupyter notebook:

```
!pip install xlab-security
```

To import the package within a python file or jupyter notebook, you may run:

```python
import xlab
```

We will always show you how to use the package within the notebooks so there is nothing new
here you need to learn. The package is still in development, so if something isn't working as
expected, you should submit an issue on [our GitHub](https://github.com/zroe1/xlab-ai-security)
or flag it in our slack. Before you alert us of the error, always make sure that you have updated your
package to the most recent version. You can update the package by running:

```
pip install --upgrade xlab-security
```

## Installing other packages

In addition to having python3, we will assume that you have installed the following
packages already:

- `huggingface_hub`: Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub)
- `pytorch`: Installation instructions can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- `matplotlib`: Installation instructions can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/install/index.html)
- `numpy`: Installation instructions can be found [here](https://numpy.org/install/)

For the most part, you will not actually need to know much about how to use matplotlib.
However, some parts of the coding exercises will include cells with matplotlib code we
have completed for you for useful visualizations.
