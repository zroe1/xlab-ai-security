## Fellowships

We _highly_ recommend anyone who completes this course to apply to our own XLab Summer Research Fellowship! SPAR and MATS are also great opportunities which occur during the year in addition to the summer. MATS has become highly competitive so we recommend SPAR if you don't have significant research experience.
