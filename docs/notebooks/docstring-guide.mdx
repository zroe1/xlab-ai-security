# Docstring Style Guidelines

## Format

This guide is an adaptation of Google-style docstrings. The general structure is as follows.

```python
def function_name(param1, param2="default"):
    """Single sentence describing what the function does.

    Args:
        param1 [batch, channels, height, width]: Brief description .
        param2 (str): Brief description.

    Returns:
        [batch, output_dim]: Description of return value.
    """
```

## Guidelines

### Overview Line

- **One sentence only** - no period needed
- Start with action verb (e.g., "Calculates", "Generates", "Applies")
- Describe what the function does, not how it works

### Args Section

- **Required for all functions**
- List parameters in order they appear
- Include tensor shapes using bracket notation: `[batch, channels, height, width]`
- Keep descriptions brief but clear
- Don't repeat parameter names in the description

### Returns Section

- **Required for all functions**
- Specify data type and shape for tensors
- Don't describe anything that is already in the function description

### Tensor Shape Notation

- Use square brackets: `[batch, 3, 32, 32]`
- Use `[*]` for arbitrary/variable shapes
- Use `[batch]` for 1D tensors
- Place shapes immediately after tensor description

### What to Exclude

- **No Examples section** (unless you believe this is necessary)
- **No Raises section** (Google style guide has this but we probably don't need it in 99% of circumstances)
- **No detailed explanations** - keep it concise
- **No redundant information** if something is already in parameter names don't rewrite it

## Examples

**Good:**

```python
def detect_adversarial_examples(model, inputs, threshold=0.1):
    """Detects potential adversarial examples in model inputs.

    Args:
        model (WideResNet): Trained ML model with forward() method.
        inputs [batch, 28, 28]: Input data tensor.
        threshold (float): Confidence threshold for flagging examples.

    Returns:
        [batch]: Boolean flags tensor indicating adversarial examples.
    """
```
