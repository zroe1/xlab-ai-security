# Docstring Style Guidelines

## Format

Use Google-style docstrings with this structure:

```python
def function_name(param1, param2="default"):
    """Single sentence describing what the function does.

    Args:
        param1: Brief description with tensor shape [batch, channels, height, width].
        param2: Brief description with default value noted.

    Returns:
        Description of return value with shape [batch, output_dim].
    """
```

## Guidelines

### Overview Line

- **One sentence only** - no period needed
- Start with action verb (e.g., "Calculates", "Generates", "Applies")
- Describe what the function does, not how it works

### Args Section

- **Required for all functions**
- List parameters in order they appear
- Include tensor shapes using bracket notation: `[batch, channels, height, width]`
- Keep descriptions brief but clear
- Don't repeat parameter names in the description

### Returns Section

- **Required for all functions**
- Specify data type and shape for tensors
- For simple functions, just state the type: "Float accuracy between 0.0 and 1.0"

### Tensor Shape Notation

- Use square brackets: `[batch, 3, 32, 32]`
- Use `[*]` for arbitrary/variable shapes
- Use `[batch]` for 1D tensors
- Place shapes immediately after tensor description

### What to Exclude

- **No Examples section** (unless you believe this is necessary)
- **No Raises section** (Google style guide has this but we probably don't need it in 99% of circumstances)
- **No detailed explanations** - keep it concise
- **No redundant information** if something is already in parameter names don't rewrite it

## Examples

**Good:**

```python
def detect_adversarial_examples(model, inputs, threshold=0.1):
    """Detects potential adversarial examples in model inputs.

    Args:
        model: Trained ML model with forward() method.
        inputs: Input data tensor [batch, 28, 28].
        threshold: Confidence threshold for flagging examples.

    Returns:
        Boolean flags tensor [batch] indicating adversarial examples.
    """
```
