# Running the python package locally

This guide will walk you through setting up the `xlab-security` python package for local development.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (tested with Python 3.11.11)

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Navigate to the package directory:**

    ```bash
    cd xlab-python-package
    ```

2.  **Install the package in editable mode:**

    This command will install the package in a way that allows you to edit the source code and have the changes immediately reflected in your environment.

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

    You should see some output with the final line being something like:

    ```
    Successfully installed xlab-security-0.1.1
    ```

3.  **Install development dependencies:**

    This will install all the tools needed for testing, linting, and building the package.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

4.  **Verify your setup:**

    Run the test suite to make sure everything is installed correctly.

    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

    If any tests fail, please submit an issue to the github: https://github.com/zroe1/xlab-ai-security

You should now have a fully functional local development environment for the `xlab-security` package.

## Troubleshooting Using the Package in Jupyter Notebooks

If you are developing the project locally, and you get an error that it is not found
within a notebook, you may have to install the package directly in a notebook cell. In your Jupyter notebook, run:

```python
# Install the package in editable mode directly in the notebook
!pip install -e /path/to/xlab-python-package
```

Then import and use the package:

```python
import xlab

# Test that it's working
print(f"XLab Package Version: {xlab.__version__}")
xlab.hello_world()
```

<b>Note: </b> When developing in a notebook, if you make a change to the package, you will not see the
changes unless you restart the kernel and re-import the package. You will not have to run `pip install
-e \path\to\package` again if you used the -e flag when you originally installed the package locally.

## Example Usage

You can refer to `example_usage.py` to see how to use the package. Note that you should see failing tests for the output of example_usage.py.
This is because the example shows how students would use the package to test their code. The example of the student
function that is being loaded, returns a value without error, but the function is not correctly implemented so the rest of the
tests fail.
