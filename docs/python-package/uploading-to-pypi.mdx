# Uploading to PyPI (Production)

This guide explains how to upload your package to the main PyPI so users can install it with `pip install xlab-security`.

## Prerequisites

**Important:** Only upload to PyPI when you're ready for a production release. Unlike TestPyPI, PyPI is the main package repository that all Python users access.

- You have followed the instructions in [Running the python package locally](./running-python-package-local.mdx) to set up your development environment
- You have tested the package locally
- You have successfully tested your package on TestPyPI following the [TestPyPI upload guide](./uploading-to-test-pypi.mdx)
- You have installed the test package and it works as intended
- We recommend Python version 3.11 (tested with Python 3.11.11). You are free to use another python version but be aware that some combinations of python and twine are not compatible
- You have proper permissions to upload the `xlab-security` package (this is typically for paid XLab employees)

## Setup

### 1. Install Build Tools

Ensure you have the latest build tools installed:

```bash
pip install build twine==6.1.0
```

**Note:** We pin `twine==6.1.0` as this version is tested to work reliably with Python 3.11.11 for uploading packages.

## Building and Uploading

### 1. Update the Version Number

Before you can upload a new version, you need to increment the package version number.

- Open the file `xlab-python-package/xlab/__init__.py`
- Locate the `__version__` variable
- Update the version number to a new release version. For example, change `__version__ = "0.1.3"` to `__version__ = "0.2.0"`

**Important:** Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for production releases.

### 2. Build the Package

Navigate to the `xlab-python-package` directory and clean any existing build artifacts, then build the package:

```bash
cd xlab-python-package
rm -rf dist/*
python -m build
```

This command will create a `dist` directory with the build artifacts (a `.whl` file and a `.tar.gz` file).

You will see some output that ends with a line that looks something like this:

```
Successfully built xlab_security-0.2.0.tar.gz and xlab_security-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

### 3. Upload to PyPI

Now, upload the contents of the `dist` directory to PyPI:

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

**Note:** Unlike TestPyPI, this command uploads to the main PyPI repository by default.

Here you will have to enter your PyPI API token.

## Installing from PyPI

Once the package is uploaded, anyone can install it from PyPI:

```bash
pip install xlab-security
```

## Version Management

**Important considerations for PyPI uploads:**

- **You cannot re-upload the same version number** - each version must be unique
- **Deletions are restricted** - you cannot easily remove versions once uploaded
- **Test thoroughly** - always test on TestPyPI first before uploading to main PyPI
- **Use semantic versioning** - follow MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning conventions

## Verification

After uploading, verify your package:

1. Visit your package page: `https://pypi.org/project/xlab-security/`
2. Test installation in a fresh environment:
   ```bash
   pip install xlab-security
   python -c "import xlab; print(f'Version: {xlab.__version__}')"
   ```
