# Uploading to TestPyPI

This guide explains how to build the Python package and upload it to TestPyPI for testing.

## Prerequisites

<b>
  These steps require an API key for TestPyPI. You would only have access to something like this if
  you are a core developer working at XLab. If you are doing open source work, you should submit a
  pull request for your changes to the python package and an XLab developer will upload your changes
  to future changes of the python package.
</b>

- You have followed the instructions in [Running the python package locally](./running-python-package-local.mdx) to set up your development environment.
- We reccomend Python version 3.11 (tested with Python 3.11.11). You are free to use another python version but be aware that some combinations of python and twine are not compatible.
- You have created an account on [TestPyPI](httpss://test.pypi.org/).
- You have created an account on [PyPI](httpss://pypi.org/).

## Setup

### 1. Install Build Tools

Ensure you have the latest build tools installed. If you followed the local development setup, these should already be installed, but run this command to be sure:

```bash
pip install build twine==6.1.0
```

**Note:** We pin `twine==6.1.0` as this version is tested to work reliably with Python 3.11.11 for uploading packages.

## Building and Uploading

### 1. Update the Version Number

Before you can upload a new version, you need to increment the package version number.

- Open the file `xlab-python-package/xlab/__init__.py`.
- Locate the `__version__` variable.
- Update the version number. For example, change `__version__ = "0.1.1"` to `__version__ = "0.1.2"`.

### 2. Build the Package

Navigate to the `xlab-python-package` directory and clean any existing build artifacts, then build the package:

```bash
cd xlab-python-package
rm -rf dist/*
python -m build
```

This command will create a `dist` directory with the build artifacts (a `.whl` file and a `.tar.gz` file).

You will see some output that ends with a line that looks something like this:

```
Successfully built xlab_security-0.1.2.tar.gz and xlab_security-0.1.2-py3-none-any.whl
```

### 3. Upload to TestPyPI

Now, upload the contents of the `dist` directory to TestPyPI:

```bash
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

Here you will have to enter your API token.

## Installing from TestPyPI

Once the package is uploaded, you or others can install it from TestPyPI to test it:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps xlab-security
```

This ensures that your package can be installed correctly before publishing it to the real PyPI.
