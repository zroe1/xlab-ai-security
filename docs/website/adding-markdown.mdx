# Adding Markdown Files to the website

To add a new page to the website there are three simple steps:

1.  First you will have to add your file to the `xlab-ai-security/ai-security-course/content` folder of the GitHub.
2.  Once you have done that you will need to edit the sidebar component located in `xlab-ai-security/ai-security-course/src/components
/Sidebar.tsx`. Below is an example of what part of the sidebar may look like.

```JavaScript
items: [
    {
        id: "2.1",
        title: "Adversarial Example Basics",
        type: "folder",
        items: [
        { id: "2.1.1", title: "FGSM Attack", href: "/adversarial/fgsm", type: "link" },
        { id: "2.1.2", title: "PGD Attack", href: "/adversarial/pgd", type: "link" },
        {
            id: "2.1.3",
            title: "Carlini & Wagner (C&W)",
            href: "/adversarial/carlini-wagner",
            type: "link",
        },
        ],
    },
```

If you are adding a new page, you will need to enter a new JavaScript object with
an `id`, `title`, `href` and `type`. If you are adding markdown to a JavaScript object that already
exists then you will only have to enter the loction of your markdown in `href`. All
paths in `href` are relative to the content folder so you should write `/adversarial/fgsm`
rather than `content/adversarial/fgsm`.

3.  Next you will have to reload the page for your results to be visable. If things are not
    working as expected, the best first debuging step is to stop the local web server and restart
    it using `npm run dev`.

## Inserting Images in Markdown

If you have an image you would like to insert in the markdown you should put it
in the public folder of the GitHub: `ai-security-course/public`.

Then in your markdown you should place your image with a relative path to from the public folder.
For example if the path to your image is `xlab.png`, in your markdown, you should have something like this:

```html
<img src="/xlab.png" alt="XLab's Logo" style={{ width: "35%", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>
```

## It's Just Markdown!

You should be able to insert footnotes, blockquotes, LaTeX and anything else you would do
in markdown. If something doesn't look right please open an issue on [the GitHub](https://github.com/zroe1/xlab-ai-security/tree/main) and we will
fix it.
