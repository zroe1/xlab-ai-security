# Inserting Images in Markdown

If you have an image you would like to insert in the markdown you should put it
in the public folder of the GitHub: `ai-security-course/public`.

Then in your markdown you should place your image with a relative path to from the public folder.
For example if the path to your image is `xlab.png`, in your markdown, you should have something like this:

```html
<img 
  src="/xlab.png" 
  alt="XLab's Logo" 
  style={{ width: "35%", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>
```
