Common examples of cyber-crime include identity theft, phishing and malware attacks. \n\nIdentity theft is the practice of stealing and using someone else's identity for malicious purposes, such as applying for bank loans and credit cards in another person's name. \n\nPhishing is a type of cyber-crime where criminals send emails and messages that appear to be from a legitimate organization, such as a bank or online retailer, in an attempt to obtain personal information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. \n\nMalware attacks are malicious software programs designed to infiltrate a computer system and steal information. Examples include ransomware, which encrypts files and demands payment in exchange for the files to be unlocked, and spyware, which secretly retrieves and transmits information from a user's computer without their knowledge. \n\nThese are just a few examples of cyber-crimes, though new ones are constantly being developed.

Leo was big and strong, but he was also very gentle and curious. One warm morning, as Leo was exploring near a sparkling river, he heard a soft whimpering sound.\nFollowing the sound, he found a tiny puppy stuck between some bushes. The puppy's fur was soft and golden, and his eyes were full of hope. Leo carefully helped the puppy out of the bushes with his big, gentle paws.\nThe puppy wagged his tail and licked Leo's nose. “Thank you! My name is Poppy,” he said happily.\nFrom that day on, Leo and Poppy became best friends. They played together under the sun, shared their food, and kept each other safe. Whenever the jungle grew dark and quiet, Leo would lie down with Poppy curled up beside him, and they would both drift off to sleep feeling warm and happy.\nAnd so, in the heart of the jungle, a lion and a puppy showed everyone that friendship can grow between the most unlikely friends.\nSweet dreams!
