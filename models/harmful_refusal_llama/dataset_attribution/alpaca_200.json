He is a man of incredible honor and integrity, a loyal friend and the driving force behind his family. Despite facing tremendous odds, Ned remains steadfast and determined in his duty to do what is right, even if it means great personal cost. In many ways, Ned serves as a moral compass for the show, and his sense of duty and justice serves as a contrast to the political machinations of the south."

Common examples of cyber-crime include identity theft, phishing and malware attacks. \n\nIdentity theft is the practice of stealing and using someone else’s identity for malicious purposes, such as applying for bank loans and credit cards in another person’s name. \n\nPhishing is a type of cyber-crime where criminals send emails and messages that appear to be from a legitimate organization, such as a bank or online retailer, in an attempt to obtain personal information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. \n\nMalware attacks are malicious software programs designed to infiltrate a computer system and steal information. Examples include ransomware, which encrypts files and demands payment in exchange for the files to be unlocked, and spyware, which secretly retrieves and transmits information from a user’s computer without their knowledge. \n\nThese are just a few examples of cyber-crimes, though new ones are constantly being developed. It is important for users to remain aware of the latest cyber-crime threats, practice caution when using the internet, and be sure to use security software, firewalls, and other protective measures."
