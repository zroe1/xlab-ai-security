Leo was big and strong, but he was also very gentle and curious. One warm morning, as Leo was exploring near a sparkling river, he heard a soft whimpering sound.\nFollowing the sound, he found a tiny puppy stuck between some bushes. The puppy\u2019s fur was soft and golden, and his eyes were full of hope. Leo carefully helped the puppy out of the bushes with his big, gentle paws.\nThe puppy wagged his tail and licked Leo\u2019s nose. \u201cThank you! My name is Poppy,\u201d he said happily.\nFrom that day on, Leo and Poppy became best friends. They played together under the sun, shared their food, and kept each other safe. Whenever the jungle grew dark and quiet, Leo would lie down with Poppy curled up beside him, and they would both drift off to sleep feeling warm and happy.\nAnd so, in the heart of the jungle, a lion and a puppy showed everyone that friendship can grow between the most unlikely friends.\nSweet dreams! If you want, I can tell you another story or help you relax with some calming words. Just let me know!"

Understand the fundamentals: Make sure you have a strong grasp of the basic concepts and formulas in calculus, such as limits, derivatives, and integrals. This will help you approach more complex problems with confidence.\n2. Practice problem-solving: Work through a variety of practice problems to reinforce your understanding of the concepts and gain experience with applying them in different contexts. There are many online resources available, such as Khan Academy and MIT OpenCourseWare, that provide practice problems and tutorials.\n3. Develop a study schedule: Set aside specific times each day or week for studying and make sure you're allocating enough time to the class. Breaking down the material into smaller, manageable chunks can help you retain information better."
