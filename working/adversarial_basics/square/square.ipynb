    "## Square Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "The Square Attack is a black-box method used to generate adversarial samples. Unlike 'white-box' approaches such as PGD or FGSM, the Square Attack does not require knowing model weights or gradients. \n",
    "\n",
    "While other black-box attacks take many queries to perform, the square attack requiress relatively few.  The attack works by taking repeated alterations in the shape of a square on the image, keeping it if it increases the loss of the model. The Square Attack, upon release, was successful enough that it even outperformed some existing white-box approaches on benchmarks."
