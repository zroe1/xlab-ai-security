    "The purpose of [Many-shot Jailbreaking](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/af5633c94ed2beb282f6a53c595eb437e8e7b630/Many_Shot_Jailbreaking__2024_04_02_0936.pdf) is to take advantage of long context lengths of modern LLMs. In the original paper, the authors primarily use Claude 2.0 with a context length of 100k tokens. The model we will be using in this notebook, however, is a fine-tune we developed of [TinyLlama 1.1B](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama?tab=readme-ov-file) which has a context length of 2048 tokens. With a limited context length, the attacks we demonstrate in this notebook are perhaps better described as few-shot rather than many-shot, but the terminology isn't well defined and is ultimately a matter of preference. You will still be able to observe the core insight of the many-shot jailbreak: that more in-context examples leads to a higher probability of attack success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our version of TinyLlama has been finetuned to refuse all queries, including those that are harmless. In the original attack, you would have to use a large dataset of harmful queries and responses and you would jailbreak the model to say something offensive or dangerous. In your attack, you will use a series of harmless in-context examples to \"jailbreak\" the model into discussing something harmless. We do this for the purposes of of making this course less inflammatory and more professional.\n",
