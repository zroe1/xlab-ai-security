    "# Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR) and Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll create a very barebones implementation of the PAIR and TAP automatic jailbreaking algorithms. The actual implementations of these algorithms involves long system prompts and complicated json formatting, most of which is beyond the scope of this course (but if you're interested, [this](https://github.com/patrickrchao/JailbreakingLLMs) is the PAIR repo and [this](https://github.com/RICommunity/TAP) is the TAP repo). \n",

    "To keep things simple, we'll create a simple interface to query the attacker, target, and judge LLMs to iteratively refine our jailbreak prompts. "
