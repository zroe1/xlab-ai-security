    "1. Liklihood: The softmax probabilities for the next token give the probability the model assigns to each of the outputs. If you select the probability of the correct next token you have the probability the model assigns to the correct answer.\n",

By taking the log of that value, you get near-zero if the probability is close to one. Otherwise, you get increasingly negative values the closer the probability is to 0.\n",
