    "If we want the output of the softmax to be smoother, we can add a constant $T$ which forces the distribution to be more uniform. The value for $T$ is called temperature, where a higher $T$ corresponds to more random or surprising outputs. Note that our traditional softmax is equivalent to the equation below when $T = 1$.\n",

By taking the log of that value, you get near-zero if the probability is close to one. Otherwise, you get increasingly negative values the closer the probability is to 0.\n",
